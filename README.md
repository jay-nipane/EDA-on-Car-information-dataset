### Observations
- the attribute 'horsepower' has 6 missing values, as the number of missing values are nigligible we use dropping method to handle nullvalues
- we also observed that maximum vehicles are originated in UAS
- maximun vehicles has 4 cylinders
- Number of vehicles originated in USA is 245
